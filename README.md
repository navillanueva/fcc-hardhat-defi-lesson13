# FCC Hardhat Starter Kit Lesson 11

These are my notes and comments that I took as I followed along the course taught by Patrick Collins. By no means is the code found in this repo my creation. If you want to access a better and more clear code, check the [original repo](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js#lesson-4-remix-fund-me) where everything is posted.

I am just uploading this to save all of my notes for further study and review of what I learnt during the course.

In this lesson we created:

    1. Deposit collateral: ETH / WETH
    2. Borrow another asset: DAI
    3. Repay the DAI

We are going to learn how to interact with the protocols

FORKING A NETWORK TO OUR LOCALHOST

    Pros: quick, easy, resemble what's on mainnet
    Cons: we need an API, sone contracts are complex to work with
